# ClimaDataBox iOT sensor
ClimaDataBox is an Air Quality hardware build for Climate Challenge Hackathon of The Goethe Institut.
A DHT22 sensor connected on ESP-8266 board feeds temperature and humidity readings, as an MQ-135 gas sensor reads air quality status.
ESP-8266 uploads data to ThingSpeak IOT service. A web platform visualize data for analysis and information. This is an ongoing project and will add a PM2.5 sensor as a GPS module and a solar panel to power the hardware.
